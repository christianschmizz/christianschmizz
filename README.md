## Hi there 👋

**I am the guardian of innocent software-projects and protect them from unfortunate code and short-sighted decisions.**

### Magic sauce

My "magic" sauce is honesty and a consistent and uncompromising adherence to principles and values – the railings of every safe environment. 

#### Ingredients

- 🧑‍🏫 Focussing on forward-thinking solutions by learning the lessons and letting them go.
- 🫥 I am a strong advocate of 🩳 "Less is more", 🧠 "Don't make me think" and 🧟 "Keep it simple, stupid". 
- 🫙 I strictly believe that the best code, is code never written.
- 🌱 My mission is helping people grow and succeed. Successful people are the key to great teams and collaboration and therefor to organisational effectiveness. It's always the people.
