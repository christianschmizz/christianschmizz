## Hi there 👋

**I am Christian Schmizz ℤ, guardian of innocent software-projects. My mission is to protect us, you and me from unfortunate code and short-sighted decisions (and their consequences).**

- 🌱 Love helping people grow and succeed.  It's always the people. 
- 🧑‍🏫 Focussing on forward-thinking solutions by learning the lessons and letting them go.
- 🗿 Creating distributed systems by running *SOLID* software with the power of [event sorcery][es].
- 🫥 I am a strong advocate of 🩳 "Less is more", 🧠 "Don't make me think" and 🧟 "Keep it simple, stupid". 
- 🫙 I strictly believe that the best code, is code never written.
- ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ Avid Gopher. 🐍 Avid Pythonista and 🦄 Djangonaut.
